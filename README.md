### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student registered at the universitÃ© Paris-Saclay, in the EDPIF doctoral school.

This github regroups the methods that I try to develop for interactive and user-friendly data analysis.

These project support the analysis of data collected at synchrotrons. I believe that developing data analysis methods that can be used remotely via the jupyter project, on dedicated clustering resources are the future of data analysis at such facilities.

## Papers on data analysis softwares
